Parrot Build config scripts


this configuration folder for live-build is used
to build our official ISO images



known bugs:

something in our build process creates incorrect initramfs, the error triggers an unrecoverable kernel panic
the bug is momentaneously suppressed by manually replacing the initramfs inside the iso, but a true fix will be provided soon
